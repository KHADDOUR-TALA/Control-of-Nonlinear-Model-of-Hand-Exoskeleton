# Control-of-Nonlinear-Model-of-Hand-Exoskeleton
Three control strategies were suggested to control the proposed hand exoskeleton model: PD compensator multivariable control, inverse-dynamics nonlinear PID, and direct model reference adaptive control (DMRAC). A comparative and analytical evaluation was conducted to assess the performance and efficiency of these control strategies.
